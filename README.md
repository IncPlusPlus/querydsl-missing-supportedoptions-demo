# This repository now only serves a historical purpose
This repo's purpose was to demonstrate an issue. This issue was fixed with the merge of [querydsl#2773](https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl/pull/2773). Now this repos only purpose is to be one of the few examples of how to configure Querydsl with Gradle. As such, I'm going to simply archvie it and hope it proves useful to someone stumbling upon it while trying to configure Querydsl annotation processors in their Gradle project.
